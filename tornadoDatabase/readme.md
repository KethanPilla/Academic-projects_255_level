Purpose
- This project processes tornado data from a file and provides statistics on tornado occurrences. The data includes year, location, Fujita 
  scale rating, wind speed, and fatalities. The program allows users to analyze and extract useful information from the data, such as sorting 
  and filtering based on different parameters.
